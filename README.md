# Strengthening Structures Against Earthquakes

## Introduction

This repository contains the project files for the MECH491 course at Koç University, focusing on the application of Viscous Wall Dampers (VWDs) to reinforce structures against earthquakes.

## Contents

- `Earthquake`: Data and analyses pertaining to earthquake dynamics and the response of structures.
- `Tracking`: Scripts and algorithms developed for tracking the performance of VWDs.
- `Transfer Functions`: Calculations and simulations that model the behavior of structures equipped with VWDs.
- `LICENSE`: The licensing information for the use of this project's materials.
- `Mech491_FinalReport_GROUP12.docx.pdf`: The comprehensive final report detailing the project's findings.
